# SIGN UP Form Validator Project

This project is a **secure, user-friendly, and visually appealing sign-up form** with **real-time, client-side validation**. It is built with a focus on modern **UI/UX principles**, accessibility, and clean **vanilla JavaScript** for the logic. The current design features a sleek, dark, **glassmorphic theme**.

## Features

- **Real-time Validation:** Users receive immediate feedback as they type, making the sign-up process smoother.  
- **Email Validation:** Checks for a correctly formatted email address.  
- **Comprehensive Password Rules:** Enforces security by requiring:  
  - Minimum 8 characters  
  - At least one uppercase letter  
  - At least one lowercase letter  
  - At least one digit  
  - At least one special character (!@#$%, etc.)  
- **Visual Feedback:** Each password rule is individually tracked with a checkmark (✅) or cross (❌) in the UI.  
- **Password Confirmation:** Ensures the user has typed the same password in both fields.  
- **Password Visibility Toggle:** A common "eye" icon allows users to show or hide their password to prevent typos.  
- **Modern Glassmorphic UI:** A beautiful, dark-themed frosted glass effect makes the form stand out.  
- **Accessible:** Uses \`aria-live\` regions to announce errors to screen readers and provides clear visual cues.  
- **Submission Control:** The form cannot be submitted until all validation rules are met.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For the structure and semantics of the form.  
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid, utility-first styling and a responsive layout.  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles all validation logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling. No external libraries or frameworks are required.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Security:** Implement CAPTCHA to prevent bot sign-ups.  
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Allow users to switch between dark and light themes.  
- **Improved Accessibility:** Add keyboard navigation enhancements and screen reader optimizations.  
- **Responsive Animations:** Smooth transitions and animations for input focus, validation changes, and form submission feedback.  
- **Password Strength Meter:** A visual indicator of password strength beyond the rule checks.
